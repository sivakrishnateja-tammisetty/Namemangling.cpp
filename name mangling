* Name Mangling : It is a technique used by compilers to encode additional information into variables or functions in compiled code.
  Name mangling is primarily used to differentiate between functions or variables with the same name but different signatures or contexts.


Eg:
class MyClass {
public:
    void myFunction(int x);
    void myFunction(double x);
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.myFunction(42);
    obj.myFunction(3.14);
    return 0;
}


Note:When this code is compiled, the compiler might generate mangled names for the two myFunction methods to differentiate them based on their parameter types. 
  The actual mangled names would depend on the compiler and platform. In the compiled code, you might see something like _ZN7MyClass11myFunctionEi for the myFunction(int x) method and _ZN7MyClass11myFunctionEd for the myFunction(double x) method.
